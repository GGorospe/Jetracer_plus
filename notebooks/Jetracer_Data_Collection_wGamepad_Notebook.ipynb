    "About: In this notebook we'll use the gamepad to control our Jetracer while we collect data.\n",
    "This method is very important and useful because we can use the control input or steering command from the gamepad as our \"label\" for the data. That is given a certain situation, steer the robot as I have steered the robot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we need to better understand how we will control our JetRacer. This includes understanding the signals for steering and the signals for the throttle.\n",

    "This notebook will help us understand these and practice driving."
